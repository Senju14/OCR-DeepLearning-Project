# 📝 OCR – Deep Learning Course Project

This repository contains an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model developed as part of a Deep Learning university course. The model learns to recognize and extract text from images using neural networks.

## 🔍 Project Highlights
- Built using PyTorch and Google Colab
- Trained on a labeled image-text dataset
- Handles printed and synthetic characters
- Includes pre-processing, model training, and evaluation
- Final results documented in a structured PDF report
